I redesigned the logo of our lab because the original one was too detailed to be engraved on a pen. I admire people on the earth who do graphic design. I basically spent half a day to finish this simple logo...

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/original_pen_logo.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/simplified_pen_logo.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    On the left, the original logo of our lab. On the right, the simplified logo that can be engraved on a pen.
