I independently developed a motion simulator for robotic manipulators that aids in detecting collisions and visualizing movements. By combining a left-child, right-sibling tree data structure with the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention, I utilized a preorder traversal algorithm to efficiently draw and display complex assemblies. I also invented the Single-Axis Dragging algorithm, enabling users to control the joint-space motion of a six-axis robotic arm with simple click-and-drag interactions. Additionally, I created a patent-pending 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) interactive marker and algorithm, allowing intuitive manipulation of a robot's end-effector position and orientation. To solve the Inverse Kinematics problem, I implemented the Damped Least Squares method for numerical optimization.
