I independently developed software that schedules the measuring procedures for a robotic manipulator, enabling users to generate optimal test paths for measuring the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters of a robotic arm. This innovative solution increased the efficiency of the measuring process by an impressive fifteen times while ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the measurement results.
