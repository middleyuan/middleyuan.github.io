# How to Learn a New Skill

1. **Break down the skill**  
   Clearly define what you want to achieve, then break the skill into smaller, manageable parts for focused learning.

2. **Learn enough to self-correct**  
   Acquire just enough knowledge to start practicing and be able to recognize and correct your own mistakes as you go.

3. **Eliminate practice barriers**  
   Identify and remove distractions or obstacles that prevent you from practicing consistently.

4. **Commit to 20 hours of practice**  
   Dedicate at least 20 hours to practicing the skill. This helps you push through the initial frustration and stick with it long enough to see real progress.

5. **The biggest challenge is emotional, not intellectual**  
   The real barrier is often emotional resistance rather than lack of ability or understanding.
