I am a scientific researcher in [Learning Systems and Robotics Lab](https://www.dynsyslab.org/vision-news/) at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) advised by [Prof. Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/).  I hold a Master’s degree in Robotic Systems Engineering from [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1). During my master study, I completed a research internship at [AUDI AG](https://www.audi.com/en/company.html), where my focus was on AI Safety Verification for antonomous driving. I also did a semester project in [Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/ibtrg/?lidx=1), led by [Prof. Sebastian Trimpe](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/DSME/Das-Institut/Team-CMS-Artikel-/~jlolt/Prof-Sebastian-Trimpe). My research interests include (but are not limited to) Efficient Risk-Averse Bayesian Optimization, AI Safety Verification, and (Safe) Reinforcement Learning.

I am actively working on two projects: 1) Benchmarking Learning-based Control and Reinforcement Learning, and 2) Efficient Risk-Averse Bayesian Optimization for Robot Learning. Aside from research, I have practical experience in model identification, extended Kalman filter, and control deployment on real drones.
